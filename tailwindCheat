tailwind css is the mobile first css..It mainly gives preference to mobile, for larger devices we must use breakPoints.

flex = By default, it put items into rows!

space-x-_ = gives spacing in x-axis.

items-center = put all the items center!

p-5 = gives padding alround the items!

border-r = gives border on the right side!

To use the custom values = border-t-[0.1px]..

To make the Scrolling effect smoother & fixed = h-screen overflow-hidden

min-h-screen = to make the min.height to full size of the Screen

h-screen - take as much space as the screen has!

overflow-y-scroll = When we have too much of information, we must scoll over it!

flex-grow = take as much room as possible

absolute - making that div to float in another div(relative, we need not to mention), we must specify its position(top, right)

shadow-2xl = Gives shadow in the bottom!

hidden md:inline-flex = Hidden in mobileView, only visible after the breakpoint - Medium screen! arranges itself in row

ml-auto = margin-left will be fixed as auto!

justify-between = justify a space between them.

grid grid-cols-2 = grid box of column 2.

sticky bottom-0 = making the div sticky at bottom.

hidden md:inline = Hidden in mobileView, only visible after the breakpoint - Medium screen! arrangement is default here!

justify-evenly = leave space evenly!

justify-end = put everything in the end!
